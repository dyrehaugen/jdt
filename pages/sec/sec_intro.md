This section comprises stuff on various Souls of importance to me,
starting out with [Dogs](act_dogs.html).

[Goto Souls Overview](act_intro.html)

### 2. Episodes

Episodes that have made an impact on me.
A lot of experiences - from all walks of life, around the globe -
how these will show up here remains to be seen ...

### 3. Places 

Here I put stuff related to locations of particular interest to me.
I start out with the two places I stay more permanently:
[Gran Canaria](/loc_canaria.html) and [Norway](/loc_norway.html).

[Goto Places Overview](loc_intro.html)

### 4. Issues 

Experiences leads to opinions on what matters in life and society -
in a global perspective.
I will try to present observersations and explain the reasoning behind
some of my most explicit opinions on issues that concerns me - like:
[capitalism](cap_intro.html),
[climate change](clm_intro.html),
[environment](env_intro.html) and
[urbanisation](urb_intro.html)

### 5. Research 

More in-depth exploration of particular issues of interest will be put here.
What grows might later be turned into new sections in it's own right.

So far there is some material on
[modelling financial instability](minsky.html)

and on [modelling the corona outbreak](corona.html)

What does not fit anywhere else is put here.
