### 1. [Activities](/act_intro.html)

This section comprises stuff on various activities I am involved in,
starting out with [Dogging](act_dogs.html).
I intend to expand with [Hiking](act_hiking.html),
[Swimming](act_swimming.html),
[Tennis](act_tennis.html) and
[Other](act_other.html)

### 2. [Experience](/exp_intro.html)

A lot of experiences - from all walks of life, around the globe -
how these will show up here remains to be seen ...
may be I will focus on experiences that have had the most
personal impact.

### 3. [Locations](/loc_intro.html)

Here I put stuff related to locations of particular interest to me.
I start out with the two places I stay more permanently:
[Gran Canaria](/loc_canaria.html) and [Norway](/loc_norway.html).

### 4. [Concerns](/cnc_intro.html)

Experiences leads to opinions on what matters in life and society -
in a global perspective.
I will try to present observersations and explain the reasoning behind
some of my most explicit opinions on issues that concerns me - like:
[capitalism](cap_intro.html),
[climate change](clm_intro.html),
[environment](env_intro.html) and
[urbanisation](urb_intro.html)


### 5. [Research](/res_into.html)

More in-depth exploration of particular issues of interest will be put here.
What grows might later be turned into new sections in it's own right.

So far there is some material on
[modelling financial instability](minsky.html)


### 6. [Varia](/var_intro.html)

What does not fit anywhere else is put here.
Currently here is just some test on how to render greek letters
and mathematical symbols with Jekyll.
