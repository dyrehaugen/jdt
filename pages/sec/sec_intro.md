[Other](act_other.html)

### 2. [Experience](/exp_intro.html)

A lot of experiences - from all walks of life, around the globe -
how these will show up here remains to be seen ...
may be I will focus on experiences that have had the most
personal impact.


### 3. [Concerns](/cnc_intro.html)

Experiences leads to opinions on what matters in life and society -
in a global perspective.
I will try to present observersations and explain the reasoning behind
some of my most explicit opinions on issues that concerns me - like:
[capitalism](cap_intro.html),
[climate change](clm_intro.html),
[environment](env_intro.html) and
[urbanisation](urb_intro.html)


### 4. [Research](/res_into.html)

More in-depth exploration of particular issues of interest will be put here.
What grows might later be turned into new sections in it's own right.

So far there is some material on
[modelling financial instability](minsky.html)


### 5. [Varia](/var_intro.html)

What does not fit anywhere else is put here.
Currently here is just some test on how to render greek letters
and mathematical symbols with Jekyll.


### 6. [Norway](nor_intro.html)

Staying in Asker, close to Oslo, with the fjord and mountains ut to 400m
within walking range, 'Dyrehaugen' is my homestead Up North.
I would like to document the qualities of Norway - and my own place in
particular - as a living environment.


### 7. [Gran Canaria](/grc_intro.html)

On Gran Canaria - a small bungalow named 'Casa del Lobo' is my homestead
Down South -
a place to enjoy the sun even in the winter time - without losing the
sight of snow (on top of Mount Teide - 3500 m)
