## ENERGY

>Labour without energy is a corpse, and capital without energy is a sculpture. (Steve Keen)

### SOLAR


### WIND

#### Coreolis

Looking toward a windmill - with the wind from behind - it rotates clockwise.
On the Northern Hemisphere they could possibly produce more energy by rotating the other way.
This intersting article takes us on a revisit to the Coreolis Effect.

#### Windpower Capital trashes Costal Wildlife

Badly located windparks along the Norwegian coastline are extremely harmful to
protected birdlife. Local nature protection is overun by powerful Wind Energy Capital
interest.
