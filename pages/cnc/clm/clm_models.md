# Climate Models

#### Nordhaus' Modelling

From Blair Fix:

The conflation of income with productivity has led economists to misunderstand the role of natural resources in human societies. Economists see that the owners of natural resources earn a trivial share of income. And so they conclude (wrongly) that natural resources themselves play a trivial role in the economy. It’s an embarrassing mistake with troubling consequences.

Take, as an example, the need to fight climate change. If you ask a climate scientist, they’ll likely say that climate change poses a dire threat to humanity. Their reasoning is simple. Climate change could potentially make farming impossible in much of the world. So if we want to avoid mass starvation, we’d best curb our fossil fuel habit.

In contrast, if you ask a neoclassical economist about fighting climate change, you’ll get a very different answer. Climate change, they’ll likely say, isn’t much of a problem. True, it may cause much of our arable land to become barren … but don’t worry. Agriculture, they’ll observe, is a tiny part of GDP. So even if we destroy our ability to farm, ‘economic output’ will remain virtually unchanged.

Given its absurdity, you might think that I’m making this reasoning up. But I’m not. William Nordhaus — whose work on the economics of climate change has been enormously influential — uses the same reasoning to downplay the impact of global warming. Here’s how he peddles it:

>T]he process of economic development and technological change tend progressively to reduce climate sensitivity as the share of agriculture in output and employment declines and as capital-intensive space heating and cooling, enclosed shopping malls, artificial snow, and accurate weather or hurricane forecasting reduces the vulnerability of economic activity to weather
… More generally, underground mining, most services, communications, and manufacturing are sectors likely to be largely unaffected by climate change—sectors that comprise around 85 percent of GDP.

Although climate change may destroy our food supply, we shouldn’t worry. According to Nordhaus, we’ll all be safe inside our air-conditioned offices, with productivity unimpaired.

There’s a fatal flaw in this thinking. The decline in agriculture’s income share says nothing about agriculture’s biophysical importance. To see the biophysical importance of agriculture, we should look not at the income-accounting table, but at the kitchen table. No agriculture … means no food … means no humans.

Far from indicating agriculture’s irrelevance, the evidence shows agriculture’s continued importance. Industrial society is possible only because so few people are needed to grow food. (That’s why farmers earn such a tiny share of all income. There are hardly any of them!) Modern farmers harvest a staggering quantity of food. This allows the rest of us to do the non-farming activities that we take for granted.
Without the bounty of modern agriculture, urban life would be impossible.

#### Climate economics Nobel may do more harm than good

"Nordhaus' DICE model implicitly assumes that climate damages are worse when we are richer, and that we should start low and increase the price of carbon over time," said Wagner. "But what if climate change makes us poorer every step of the way?"

There are by now dozens of economic studies, he pointed out, showing how global warming is already hitting growth rates and productivity.

"We don't argue against DICE's conclusions with the force of an ethical argument, we offer a new model that calculates a price of CO2 by taking the financial economic view seriously," Wagner added.

"And that price is not the $20, $30 or $40 that Bill comes up with. In our model, we can't get our price below $120 a tonne."

#### ECS - Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity

>ECS translates a doubling
of atmospheric CO2 concentrations into
eventual global average temperature
rise. It has been persistently difficult to
pin ECS down in that 'likely' estimates
for decades have ranged from 1.5  C to
4.5  C per doubling of CO2.

#### SCC - Social Cost of Carbon SCC

>Although precise definitions vary, the
goal of the SCC is to quantify the tradeoffs
between the benefits and costs of cutting
CO 2 emissions and to capture them in a
single number: the price that society
pays for emitting a marginal ton of CO2
The SCC is also the price that each of
us should pay for emitting an additional
ton. The SCC is important for designing
policies such as carbon prices. More
broadly, the SCC summarizes the ur-
gency of dealing with climate change. A
low SCC would be grounds for delaying
transformative changes to our energy
infrastructure. A high SCC, meanwhile, in-
dicates that we will pay dearly for not
acting decisively now.

>The SCC is highly sensitive to uncertainty
in both climate and weather extremes.
Both extreme
climate change and extreme weather, in
turn, lead the most current SCC estimates
to be biased toward lower values, often
significantly so. By underestimating the
SCC, we are underestimating the need
for drastic climate action.

>On the cost side, most
climate-economy models fail to account
for how technological progress and the
deployment of new low-carbon technolo-
gies depend on investment over time

>Calculating the benefits of cut-
ting CO 2 emissions—or, conversely, the
costs of unmitigated climate change—in-
volves two main steps: one physical and
one economic. The first links the marginal
ton of emitted CO 2 to the resulting warm-
ing, and the second links it to the resulting
economic impacts. Both the magnitude
and damages of future climate change
are beset with significant and recalcitrant
uncertainties, 5 translating into large un-
certainties in the SCC. As a result, the
SCC is often presented as a draw of out-
comes from a simulation exercise that
generates a distribution of possible out-
comes around a particular median or cen-
tral estimate.

>Because damages are generally
represented as a function of overall warm-
ing and often rely on global approxima-
tions for damages, there is no direct ac-
counting for changes in extreme events.

>Even small changes in mean
warming can lead to large changes in
the probability of extreme temperatures,
which in turn can have devastating conse-
quences.
Because
economic damages are particularly large
for extreme events, any such increase in
their intensity will have an outsized impact
on the SCC.

>Many of the known
processes that are poorly quantified,
such as effects from clouds, have signifi-
cantly more potential to amplify rather
than dampen warming.


>The world is riding
the complex climate system into a state for which
there is no good analog in over a million
years. This makes forecasting climate
change a fundamentally tricky out-of-sample
prediction problem. Surprises are sure
to exist, and if they could be quantified,
they would also primarily push the SCC to-
ward higher values.

>There is a lot of room on the
extreme warming tail of ECS, whereas
values of ECS lower than about 1  C can
be ruled out given that global average
temperatures have already risen by as
much, even though CO 2 has yet to double
from pre-industrial levels. This skews un-
certainties in long-term physical climate
impacts toward higher rather than lower
temperatures.

>The more fundamental reason for why
unknown unknowns should increase the
SCC are ever-present threshold effects.
Even symmetric uncertainty in how
extreme events will change nonetheless
leads to potentially large increases in
climate damages and thus the SCC.

>Uncertainty in the consequences of
climate change has often been advocated
as a reason to delay action. "We
don’t yet know for sure," the argument
goes, "so we better wait and see and do
more research".
Quite the contrary. As
our knowledge advances, it is much
more likely that the true SCC will reveal it-
self to be larger than current estimates. It
is precisely the uncertainties that make
climate change so costly.

#### Extreme Event Attribution

Since 1980 the top five most expensive events were all hurricanes and
all took place in the last six years

How can we be confident human greenhouse gas emissions causes this development?
