Third of Earth's soil is acutely degraded due to agriculture.
Fertile soil is being lost at rate of 24bn tonnes a year
through intensive farming. 

With our current trends in production, urbanization, and environmental
degradation, we are losing and wasting too much land.
We are losing our connection with the earth.
We are losing far too quickly the water, soil, and biodiversity
that support all life.
At a time when every asset and every option to deliver benefits to people
and the planet should be being harnessed,
the availability of good quality land is declining.
As Mark Twain jokingly put it “Buy land, they’re not making it anymore.”

Yet the Global Land Outlook (UNCCD) keeps up an optimistic spirit -
still thinking that global ecological problems can be resolved
*within capitalism*:

We need to think in terms of respect for limits,
not limits to growth:
we can take immediate action without compromising the quality of life today
or our aspirations for the future;
informed and responsible decision-making,
along with simple changes in our everyday lives,
can help promote economic growth
while at the same time reverse the current trends in land degradation.

If it only was that easy!
