## The Great Acceleration

The second half of the 20th Century is unique.
Proliferation of capitalism has resulted in
sharp acceleration of industrial activities around the globe.

The last 60 years have profoundly transformed
mankind's relationship to the natural world.

The effects are now clearly discernible at the Earth system level.
The human imprint on the planet is discernible on
all components of the global environment -
oceans, coastal zone, atmosphere, and land.
