## Reign in Capitalism

Capitalism success is terrible for nature.

Capitalism is a profit-driven economic system.
It has been a tremendeous success - on it's own terms.
For the planet it is en route to become a disaster.
During the *Great Acceleration* - the last half century -
the scale of the capitalist enterprise has grown far
beyond what the Earth can sustain - the current level
actually requires 1.6 Earth.

We need a different economic system.
Environmental action is about reigning in capitalism -
and creating a different economic system.




### Pesticides

Farmers and governments have been comprehensively conned by
the global pesticide industry.
It has ensured its products should not be properly regulated or even,
in real-world conditions, properly assessed.
A massive media onslaught by this industry has bamboozled us all about
its utility and its impacts on the health of both human beings
and the natural world.
The profits of these companies depend on ecocide.

What we need to do:

1 We need a global treaty to regulate pesticides, and put the manufacturers back in their box.

2 We need environmental impact assessments for the farming and fishing industries. It is amazing that, while these sectors present the greatest threats to the living world, they are, uniquely in many nations, not subject to such oversight.

3 We need firm rules based on the outcomes of these assessments, obliging those who use the land to protect and restore the ecosystems on which we all depend.

4 We need to reduce the amount of land used by farming, while sustaining the production of food. The most obvious way is greatly to reduce our use of livestock: many of the crops we grow and all of the grazing land we use are deployed to feed them. One study in Britain suggests that, if we stopped using animal products, everyone in Britain could be fed on just 3m of our 18.5m hectares of current farmland (or on 7m hectares if all our farming were organic). This would allow us to create huge wildlife and soil refuges: an investment against a terrifying future.

5 We should stop using land that should be growing food for people to grow maize for biogas and fuel for cars.
