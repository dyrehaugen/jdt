Oceans and marine life are at risk form pollution, overfishing, the destruction of coastal habitats, and acidification.

The Seafood Business for Ocean Stewardship (SeaBOS) initiative,
supported by the Stockholm Resilience Centre,
marks the first time that companies from Asia, Europe and the US
have come together aiming to end unsustainable practices.

Although the fishing industry is highly fragmented at the local level,
with millions of small boats and subsistence fishermen,
about 11 to 16% of the global catch goes to just 13 companies,
who are thought to control about 40% of the most valuable and biggest species.
The nine fishing companies signed up to SeaBOS have a combined annual revenue
of about $30bn (£23bn),
making up more than one-third of that of the top 100 seafood companies

Fish farms have also been a cause of concern to ocean experts,
with the heavy use of medicines and disinfectants causing marine pollution,
and the use of millions of tonnes of fishmeal from ground-up wild fish
to provide food for the farmed fish –
as much as five tonnes of wild fish for every tonne of farmed.
These factors undermine the claims of the fish farming industry to provide a sustainable source of fish.
