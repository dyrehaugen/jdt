### Forest Mortality

reports on various studies of tropical forest dynamics.
Rising temperature is a *forest mortality* driver.
> direct and indirect human action have – in the big picture – affected the way forests shelter new seedlings, the growth of all trees, and the rate of death of those trees. Mortality is going up, while recruitment and growth are faltering.
