## The Symbiosis between Market and State 

Under the title 'The fourth power?' *Wolfgang Streeck* 
in New Left Review 110, March-April 2018 makes a review of 
*Joseph Vogl: The Ascendancy of Finance (2017)*, 
first published in German as *Der Souverãnitãtseffekt (2015)*
Here we find a lot of interesting characterizations of Current Capitalism.
Below follows some extracts.

In fact, according to
Vogl, states became sovereign by co-opting finance into their emerging
sovereignty and parcelling out part of that sovereignty to the markets, thereby
creating a private enclave within public authority endowed with a sovereignty
of its own. Just as modern society could not have been monetized
without state authority, so the state could only become society’s executive
committee by making finance the executive committee of the state.
Money, then, emerges in what Vogl calls ‘zones of indeterminacy’, where
private and public interests are reconciled by assigning public status to the
former and privatizing the latter. The result is a complex interlocking of
conflict and cooperation generative of, and benefiting from, what Vogl calls
‘seigniorial power’—a relationship in which the state and finance undertake
to govern one another and, together, society at large.

It is in crisis situations, when banks are about to collapse or states
teeter on the edge of insolvency, that the liberal notion of a clear distinction
between markets and the state is exposed as a myth. On such occasions,
as financial and political elites join forces in a virtual boardroom, func-
tional differentiation—the pet category of functionalist sociology—loses
its meaning and sovereignty reveals a Schmittian face, declaring a state
of emergency and die Stunde der Exekutive. As Vogl shows in his account
of the Wall Street ‘rescue operation’ of autumn 2008, in the hour of the
executive, huge public funds suddenly become available to exclusive circles
of bankers and their presumptive overseers. Working together as the clock
ticks, they take command decisions whose consequences nobody can pre-
dict, in an effort to maintain at least the appearance of control over events,
and to prevent the pyramid of promises that is financialized capitalism
from collapsing under the weight of mounting suspicion that it might have
become unmanageable.

In calmer times, the two poles of seigniorial power—the state and the
market—meet and merge in the central bank, the hybrid institutional core
of capitalism’s ‘zone of indeterminacy’....
What distinguishes them as a type is that they
exist to protect finance from the fickleness of political rulers—absolutist or
democratic—while providing the latter with at least the illusion of control
over the fickleness of financial markets. Institutional independence is cru-
cial, nowadays meaning above all insulation from electoral politics. Monetary
questions must be de-politicized—which is to say, de-democratized. Central
banks, Vogl argues, constitute a fourth power, overshadowing legislature,
executive and judiciary, and integrating financial-market mechanisms into
the practice of government.

Rising political-economic volatility implies a loss of power for Vogl’s cen-
tral banks, and a loss of respect as well. In July 2017, a year after its embrace
of radical uncertainty, the same investment house explained to its clients
why interest rates were, and would remain, so low. Central banks do not figure
in the story at all. Instead the culprit is the ‘superstar firm’, its rise made pos-
sible by new technology and globalized markets. To quote: ‘superstar firms
make higher profits, save more than they invest and pay out a smaller share
of their value-added to labour.’ This explains ‘key macro phenomena such as
the global ex ante excess of saving over investment, rising income and wealth
inequality, and low wage inflation despite falling un­employment, all of
which has contributed to the current environment of low natural and actual
interest rates, which in turn supports high valuations for the superstars.’ In
this ‘winner takes most’ world, economic concentration is increasing. Large
firms sit on huge cash hoards while labour’s income share declines. High
wages for the privileged few employed by superstar firms, combined with
weak wage pressure in an increasingly fragmented low-wage sector, make
for worsening inequality, adding to the global savings glut as ‘high-income,
wealthy individuals have a higher propensity to save than low-income, less
wealthy ones’—an account remarkable for its similarity with standard ‘radi-
cal’ explanations of the crisis of contemporary capitalism. Together, these
dynamics keep inflation down even if central banks want prices to go up.
Therefore, the experts say, ‘the investment strategy of choice’ must be one
calibrated to a ‘long-term low interest-rate environment’.

In a final chapter titled ‘Reserves of Sovereignty’, Vogl deals with the
submersion of nationally organized financial sectors—rendered politi-
cally unmanageable by financial innovation and the internationalization of
capital—into an emerging global regime. Here again, Vogl’s command of
his conceptual apparatus enables him to make sense of a highly complex
process, conceived as yet another permutation of the relationship between
the public and the private, and amounting to the conversion of ‘regulation’
into ‘governance’—in particular, ‘global governance’. Financialization for
Vogl essentially involves the transfer of financial oversight to the financial
markets themselves, ultimately establishing oversight of states by markets.
Subjected to the dictates of capital accumulation, the relations that make up
the infrastructure of social life are financialized, depoliticized and indeed
de-socialized. Responsibility for economic order shifts from constitutional,
potentially democratic, governments to ‘a patchwork of public entities,
international organizations, treaties and private actors which superintends
the privatization of regulation and, as a consequence, the marketization
and informalization of law and legal institutions’. As governance is privat-
ized, finance becomes the sole remaining sovereign.


...it might have been worth his while to place the evolving relalionship
between public spending, public debt, taxation and interest, and
the public-choice rhetoric surrounding this, in a larger political-economic
context transcending institutional analysis proper. What if the pressure for
ever-higher public spending was a reflection, not of democratic ‘irrespon-
sibility’, but of what in Marxian language would be described as a secular
tendency toward the ‘socialization of production’, giving rise to a functional
need for private profit-making to be supported by an increasingly elaborate,
and correspondingly more expensive, public infrastructure? It is here that
Vogl’s institutional analysis of the bipolar world of his zone of indetermi-
nacy might have benefitted from being embedded in a political economy
of contemporary capitalism, a context in which it would greatly contribute
to our understanding of a, shall we say, dialectical ‘contradiction’ between
the limited supply of tax revenue on the one hand—caused by capital’s
reluctance to be taxed—and on the other, the growing demands, including
capitalist demands, for public prepare-and-repair work, from education to
environmental clean-up; for public security, from citizen surveillance in the
centre to anti-insurgency on the periphery; and for public compensation of
citizens for loss of income and status due to capitalist creative destruction.

...states must be willing
and able to service and repay their debt reliably, and it is here that central
banks still seem to play an important role in the management of ‘financia-
lized’ capitalism. Not only can they mediate between states and the financial
industry—bankrolling the former and allowing the latter to trade govern-
ment debt for profit—they also help to keep public debt at a level where states
can still be trusted by their private creditors.

So far Streeck/Vogl. Today The Guardian has a article on the replacement of
Mark Carney as head of Bank of England - foreseen to come just after Brexit
comes into effect. Carney is charcterized this way: ...
*one of the few senior policymakers taking measured decisions in the national interest rather than the narrow party interest that dominates parliament. So it’s a tall order finding a replacement.*

Parliamentary democracy seems to be lost in a cul-de-sac.
Luckily we can count on the New Enlightened Rulers of the Central Banks.

*Yanis Varoufakis* adds a different twist to this analysis in his comment on
Project Syndicat in August 2018:

Austerity prevails in the West
because three powerful political tribes champion it.
Enemies of big government have coalesced with European social democrats and
tax-cutting US Republicans,
to create a cartel-based, hierarchical, financialized global economic system.

...capitalism has been evolving.
The vast majority of economic decisions have long ceased to be shaped by
market forces
and are now taken within a strictly hierarchical, though fairly loose,
hyper-cartel of global corporations.
Its managers fix prices, determine quantities, manage expectations,
manufacture desires, and
collude with politicians to fashion pseudo-markets that subsidize
their services....

...as the hyper-cartel became financialized
(turning companies like General Motors into large speculative
financial corporations that also made some cars),
the aim of GDP growth was replaced with that of
“financial resilience”:
ceaseless paper asset inflation for the few and
permanent austerity for the many...

...an overarching dynamic that, under the guise of free-market capitalism,
is creating a cartel-based, hierarchical, financialized global economic system.

## Monetary Policy

### Who creates Money/Debt?

The lost lesson of the 2007 financial crisis is that current economic-growth models are “overly reliant on liquidity and leverage – from private financial institutions, and then from central banks.”[(Mohamed El-Erian)](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/lost-lessons-of-the-financial-crisis-by-mohamed-a--el-erian-2017-08). Financial markets’ performance today is driven by the expectation of continued central-bank liquidity. 

Derivatives markets created a system of largely fraudulent circular insurance that allows bankers to raid their bank capitals and pay it out to themselves and select shareholders as bonus. What this amounts to practically is a license to print counterfeit money through fraudulent credit. Fraudulent credit can be defined as credit that is designed at origination to be impossible or highly unlikely to be repaid. [(Mirek Fatyga)](blog-integrity-of-money.html)

With the rise of financialization, commercial banks have become increasingly reliant on one another for short-term loans, mostly backed by government bonds, to finance their daily operations. This liquidity acquires familiar properties: used as a means of exchange and as a store of value, it becomes a form of money.
And there’s the rub: as banks issue more inter-bank money, the financial system requires more government bonds to back the increase. The growing inter-bank money supply fuels demand for government debt, in a never-ending cycle that generates tides of liquidity over which central banks have little control.
In this brave new financial world, central banks’ independence is becoming meaningless, because the money they create represents a shrinking share of the total money supply. With the rise of inter-bank money, backed mostly by government debt, fiscal policy has become an essential factor in determining the quantity of actual money lubricating modern capitalism.
Indeed, the more independent a central bank is, the greater the role of fiscal policy in determining the quantity of money in an economy. 
Money and government debt are now so intertwined that the analytical basis for central bank autonomy has disappeared.

#### Cryptocurrencies

The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies amounts to nearly one tenth the value of the physical stock of official gold, with the capability to handle significantly larger payment operations, owing to low transaction costs. That means that cryptocurrencies are already systemic in scale. 
The Central Banks can try to reign in cryptocurrencies but the genie is out of the bottle: the entire model that the combination of governments and Central Banks operate is already under huge threat.
Technology basically allows barter to operate on an industrial scale. Technology platforms now open the possibility of direct peer-to-peer transactions, entirely bypassing all banking - retail, merchant and Central. This essentially means the insertion point that governments had into all transactions is lost - which then makes it extremely difficult to extract tax from transactions.
