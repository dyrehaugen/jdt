summary: "Capitalism is an expansionary economic system - Capital Accumulation
is a core feature. Markets grow by commodifying ever new spheres of
human activity. Resource depletion and environmental degradation is
part of the process. Capitalist pay no attention to these by themselves,
only if governments constrains their behaviour, else accumulation will
go on untill nature itself strikes back."

## The Environmental Dimension

### Destroying Climate

*Will Capitalism stop when Wall Street is underwater?*


### Ruining Environment

*With this speed of increase in plastic production there will be
more plastic than fish in the oceans by 2050*

#### The Rebound Effect - Jevons Paradox

>The paradox is that we tend to assume that the more efficiently we use a resource the less of it we will use.
This efficiency-for-conservation logic appears correct for most subsets of the economy.
But at the level of the whole economy, the reverse is true. These efficiency gains contribute to increasing production and consumption, which increases the extraction of resources and the generation of wastes...
Environmental policy focused on efficiency gains does not by itself benefit the environment. Economies grow by developing and deploying increasingly efficient technologies...
The real paradox: the ability to use a resource more efficiently makes it both cheaper and more valuable at the same time...
In an economy designed to grow [i.e. Capitalism], the Jevons paradox is all but inevitable...
The focus on making energy use more efficient is paradoxically worsening the problem [of Climate Change], as efficiency gains facilitate increasing, not decreasing, carbon burning...
Collectively limiting ourselves offers [the only] escape from capitalismâ€™s endless loops of efficiency and growth... Limits do not mean reductions or sacrifice but an opportunity to pursue goals other than growth.
Efficiency makes growth - Limits make creativity.,,
Society can purposefully choose less-efficient production processes, setting the paradox in reverse by
[deliberately] constraining the scale of the economy.

### Sustainability
#### Affluence drives environmental degradation

>For over half a century, worldwide growth in affluence has continuously increased resource
use and pollutant emissions far more rapidly than these have been reduced through better
technology. The affluent citizens of the world are responsible for most environmental impacts
and are central to any future prospect of retreating to safer environmental conditions.

>Any transition towards
sustainability can only be effective if far-reaching lifestyle changes complement technological
advancements. However, existing societies, economies and cultures incite consumption
expansion and the structural imperative for growth in competitive market economies inhibits
necessary societal change.
