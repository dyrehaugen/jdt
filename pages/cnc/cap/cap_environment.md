summary: "Capitalism is an expansionary economic system - Capital Accumulation
is a core feature. Markets grow by commodifying ever new spheres of
human activity. Resource depletion and environmental degradation is
part of the process. Capitalist pay no attention to these by themselves,
only if governments constrains their behaviour, else accumulation will
go on untill nature itself strikes back."
