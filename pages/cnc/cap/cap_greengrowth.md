### 'Green Growth' is a dangerous political illusion

1. Seemingly less material footprint in rich nation is an artefact of outsourcing.

2. On a globale level outsourcing is impossible.

3. Shift to services does not reduce material footprint

4. Decoupling (economic growth from material and energy use) globally does not occur 

>Growth ends up wiping out the gains we achieve through efficiency improvements (Jevons Paradox).

>The only fail-safe strategy is to impose legally binding caps on resource use and gradually ratchet it back down to safe levels.
