### Scaling Laws

"Scaling laws are power-law relationships of the form $Y = cX^β$, where $Y$ represents a
variable which varies in a systematic way with the size $X$ of subsystems and $c$ and $β$ are
parameters. They have two powerful advantages: they summarize structural features of
systems in a very efficient way, and they reveal the effect of universal constraints acting
on the structure and development over several orders of magnitude in these systems...
The main resources enabling urban
development are the technical and cultural innovations which increase the productivity,
the diversity and the cohesion of human activities; the availability of these resources
relies on the production and exchanges of information ...
The role of cities as centers for the integration of human capital and as incubators
of invention was rediscovered by the “new” economic growth theory, which posits that
knowledge spillovers among individuals and firms are the necessary underpinnings of
growth (Lucas 1988, Romer 1986) ...
This seemingly spontaneous
process, whereby knowledge produces growth and growth attracts knowledge, is the
engine by which urban centers sustain their development through unfolding innovation.
The essential role of knowledge generation, recombination and circulation within and
across urban areas must be at the core of any proposed explanation for urban scaling."

### Scaling Math

Urban Scaling Research finds that Social Contact Intensity is linked to City Size approximately
as a power law:

$k(N) = k_{0} N^β$

with β = 1 + δ and δ ≈ 1/6  acording to [Bettencourt](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/340/6139/1438).

Fig 2. Power Law of Urban Scaling 

Fig 2 illustrates the power of scaling. The red line has δ = 0.15 and the green half of this,
δ = 0.075. Both are cases of *positive* or *superlinear* scaling. For comparion δ can also be
negative (sublinear), i.e.larger cities have smaller effects,
as illustrated on the figure with δ = 0.85 (blue line).

A scaling factor of δ = 0.15 is fairly strong: An urban area with 5 times the population -
1 million people compared to another with 200.000 people - has the double Social Contact Intensity.
10 times the population (2 million people) gives 4 times the intensity.

'Social Contact Intensity' - as we use it here - is an umbrella term.
Many aspects of social and economic activity within urban areas will follow such power laws.
Many empirical studies find  power laws with β around 1.1 - 1.2 as a general charcteristic.
As Bettencourt puts it: 'Cities primary function is open-ended social reactors...
[which] exist in similar, but changing forms over a huge range of scales...
[and] evolve acording to a small set of principles that operate locally...
[so that] the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities...
[follow] scaling relations that apply to all urban systems.' .
