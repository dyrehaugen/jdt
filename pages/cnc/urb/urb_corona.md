**Social Distancing** has become the mantra of policy response to the 2020 *Corona Outbreak*.
Economic forces have for centruries pushed people closer and closer together in urban agglomerations.
The emergence of a major *pandemic* in the 21th century - although forewarned - obviously was not
a risk factor considered seriously by these same *economic forces* - neither private nor public
*decisionmakers* when promoting and allowing the construction of the great agglomerations.

*Homo Sapiens* where not made by nature to live in megacities.
The corona outbreak is a piece of nature striking back as a reminder of the vulnerability of
the artificial urban environment to the most basic of natural evolution - mutation of a virus.

[Stier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10376) provides an empirical treatment of the relation between
urban size and the speed of epidemic spread in the US during the 2020 corona outbreak.
The main findings are:

- *faster* spreading in larger cities

- *larger* fractions of the population infected 

- *more aggresive* distancing needed

The virus is new, i.e. *everyone is susceptible*.
The virus provokes a respiratory disease which makes *transmission easy*.
The reproductive number $$R_{eff}$$ seems to be higher than for ordinary influenza.
Two factors determine how contagious the disease is: 1)length of the infectious period
and 2) social contact intensity.
Cities are the best breeding ground due to the high contact intensity.

So - the fight between *Humans* and *Nature* goes on!
The bigger question - of course - being whether Humans should consider stopping creating such
large [*unhuman*] agglomerations. There are many *diseconomics to scale* - epidemics being just one.
Cities grow due to dominant *economics of scale* -i.e. benefitting the rich and powerful.
The diseconomics are borne by others. Changing the current path does not seem easy -
it goes to the core issue of *Capitalism*. This is treated [elsewhere]({{ site.url}}/cap_intro.html).
Here we return to the more narrow theme of *Urban Scaling*.

"Scaling laws are power-law relationships of the form $$Y = cX^β$$, where $$Y$$ represents a
variable which varies in a systematic way with the size $$X$$ of subsystems and $$c$$ and $$β$$ are
parameters. They have two powerful advantages: they summarize structural features of
systems in a very efficient way, and they reveal the effect of universal constraints acting
on the structure and development over several orders of magnitude in these systems...
The main resources enabling urban
development are the technical and cultural innovations which increase the productivity,
the diversity and the cohesion of human activities; the availability of these resources
relies on the production and exchanges of information ...
The role of cities as centers for the integration of human capital and as incubators
of invention was rediscovered by the “new” economic growth theory, which posits that
knowledge spillovers among individuals and firms are the necessary underpinnings of
growth (Lucas 1988, Romer 1986) ...
This seemingly spontaneous
process, whereby knowledge produces growth and growth attracts knowledge, is the
engine by which urban centers sustain their development through unfolding innovation.
The essential role of knowledge generation, recombination and circulation within and
across urban areas must be at the core of any proposed explanation for urban scaling."  (Pumain 2006)

Urban Scaling Research finds that Social Contact Intensity is linked to City Size approximately
as a power law:

$$k(N) = k_{0} N^δ$$

with $$δ \approx 1/6$$
