Introduction to the Urbanisation theme ...

### India's modernity

The expansions of the Indian economy after the globalisation reforms of 1991 have seen the rapid
growth of cities and towns. This process bypassed many of the formal models of 1950s urban
planning, which based urban settlement on zoning and formal title. Para-legal, and ‘pirate’ urbanism
has been distinctive of most Indian cities which exist largely through complex forms of tenure rather
than titled private property, porosity rather than visibility. This ‘pirate modernity,’ has shown itself
to be dynamic, and further aided by low cost technological communication networks. New liberal
arguments in India have suggested that informationalisation be transformed from tenure to title, cash
to banking, invisibility to visibility. The main strategy for this has been informational infrastructures
and biometric enumeration of the population.

Can the experiences of innovative informal/pirate modernities in Asia point to a new arrangement of
beyond purely property -based economies? Or can we update older models of the liberal normative
information commons with a new conceptual architecture that accounts for sections of the
population standing outside property or the classic commons? These would include looser, but
unpropertied forms of knowledge exchange as seen in informal production in India. In short, what
kind of questions does India and China’s emergence pose for a social theory of modernity beyond
property?
