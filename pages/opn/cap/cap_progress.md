summary: "In Capitalism's latest phase - the Neoliberal Era - the system's
capability to deliver social and economic progress has faded.
Large parts of the population has been 'left behind', i.e. excluded from
sharing the outcome of the increased productivity. While the population in
most Western countries still hold voting power, the contradiction between
Capitalism and Democracy is sharpened."

## No more Social and Economic Progress 

According to [Kotz(2008) Figure 1](pdf/Kotz2008.pdf)
the growth rate of the *real average hourly earnings* of nonsupervisory workers
in the nonagricultural private sector in the US was
-0.04% over the period 1979-2007,
while the growth rate of *output* for these workers was +1.91% -
the calculations are based on data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

This is roughly Capitalism's *neoliberal* period and the results at a first glance
may be conceived as a formidable *succes* - for *capital*, as profits capture the total
productivity increase.

The *emergence* of the neoliberal period have to be understood on the
background of problems of the 1960s and early 1970s.
The Vietnam war somehow exhausted the US economy while at the same time
social unrest and race conflicts were prevalent.
When the OPEC took control of oil prices the capitalist accumulation
stagnated while at the same time inflation blew up - the stagflation period.

The neoliberal agenda was a strategic program to discipline workers, bring
down inflation and restart capital accumulation.
During this period we also see the core of the system shifting from *corporate
industrial capital* to *financial capital* as concentration increases.

However, the taming of the labour force brought down effective demand.
This was compensated by Wall Street's clever engineering of new sources
of credit. Household debts as percentage of disposable income in the US
grew steadily from around 60% around 1980 to close to 130% in 2008
(see Kotz(2008) above,figure 4). So *capital* not only managed to put a
lid on wage increases, it also achieved to extract steadily increased
interest from mortgaging peoples homes.

When the crisis struck in 2008 Wall Street and the FED orchestrated
the salvation of the system by means of trillions of taxpayers money -
and introduced the zero-rent policy and additional fancy unconventional
monetary policy measures.
This has managed to keep the system alive on 'artifical breathing'.
Cheap money has blown up the stock market and raised indebtedness to
even higher records.

Today this policy is up against the wall - the problem being to
find a way to deflate the bubble and 'normalise' interest
without a new crash.
At the moment (Summer 2017) no one has got such a recipe -
the policy more or less continues just to buy time.

In the Nordic Countries we experienced the entry of neoliberal policies
as a conscious step by the social democrats in power.
As profits waned in the early 1980s social democratic governments in
a way panicked: the capitalists had stopped investing, workplaces were
threatened.

In a way capitalists broke the *social contract* or *class compromise*
of the 1950s and 1960s - the understanding that labour unions kept
wage increases at moderate level as long as capitalist reinvested
profits to ensure jobs growth.

As this contract was broken in the early 1980s social democratic
governments only response was to increase the profit share.
In a way they said - 'My God, The Capitalists have stopped investing,
we have to give them more money!'.
How to better reveal the social democrats are not socialists!
The socialist response would be: 'They do not reinvest their profits
according to contract - we have to take hold of their profits and
ensure the reinvestment and job creation takes place.
Social needs have to replace profitability as investment criteria'.

The 'Social Contract' worked as long as Capitalists found *domestic*
investment opportunities. These waned in the 1980s.
As *globalisation* took off Capitalists found investment opportunities
*abroad*. The *domestic* workers were 'left behind' - betrayed by
social democracy's incapabilities - now flocking to populist right-wing
parties.

Globally the picture differs - wage earners in low-income countries
have benefitted from the FDI of western companies.

So what is the status of Capitalism in the Western Countries by summer 2017?

+ Secular Stagnation?

+ Return of Socialism?
