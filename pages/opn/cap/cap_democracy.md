summary: "As large parts of the electorate in Western countries are 'left behind'
economically but still keep their voting rights the contradiction between
capitalism and democracy is sharpened.
What is in the cards? Will we have to roll down Democracy to save Capitalism?
Or will democratic revival transform Capitalism into some new form of Socialism?"

## Closing down Democracy

Recent time Capitalism contains two trends:

+ Shrinking wage share of output - stagnant incomes for ordinary people 

+ Increasing numbers excluded from the labour market

In the US the labour participation rate culminated around 2000 and
has in 2017 come down to same levels as around 1980:

The backlash surfaced with the victories
of *Brexit* and *Trump* - democratic movements opposing the 
neoliberal 'establishment' in reign for 30 years.
There are similar movements going on in most of Europe:
Podemos in Spain, Five-star-movemement in Italy, Marine Le Pen
in France, Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, Alternative für Deutschland etc.

The Brexit slogan *Take Back Control* may stand as a common message from
all these - that is *National Democratic Control* -
against globalised immigration and open labour markets.
These movements are obviously seen as contrary to the interest of
international, global capital.
Some capitalists are more outspoken than others.
Listen to Peter Thiel, well-known billionaire of Silicon Valley.
Here as reported by [Ben Tarnoff](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/21/peter-thiel-republican-convention-speech) in The Guardian:

*In a 2009 essay called The Education of a Libertarian,
Thiel declared that capitalism and democracy had become incompatible.
Since 1920, he argued, the creation of the welfare state and
"the extension of the franchise to women" had made the American
political system more responsive to more people -
and therefore more hostile to capitalism.
Capitalism is not "popular with the crowd", Thiel observed,
and this means that as democracy expands,
the masses demand greater concessions from capitalists
in the form of redistribution and regulation.
The solution was obvious: less democracy.
But in 2009, Thiel despaired of achieving this goal within the
realm of politics.
How could you possibly build a successful political movement
for less democracy?*
...
*For Thiel, a smaller, more easily manipulated mob is preferable
to a bigger one. If democracy can’t be eliminated,
at least it can be shrunk through authoritarianism.*
...
*The state becomes even more responsive to the needs of capitalists
and even less responsive to the needs of workers and citizens*

This is clear speech. Capitalists feel threathened by democracy .
We should not underestimate the force and determination with which
they will strike back. Democracy is unneccesary and might well
be replaced by more authoritarian and 'efficient' modes of
government.
