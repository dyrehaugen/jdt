### Monetary Policy

#### Who creates Money/Debt?

The lost lesson of the 2007 financial crisis is that current economic-growth models are “overly reliant on liquidity and leverage – from private financial institutions, and then from central banks.”[(Mohamed El-Erian)](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/lost-lessons-of-the-financial-crisis-by-mohamed-a--el-erian-2017-08). Financial markets’ performance today is driven by the expectation of continued central-bank liquidity. 

Derivatives markets created a system of largely fraudulent circular insurance that allows bankers to raid their bank capitals and pay it out to themselves and select shareholders as bonus. What this amounts to practically is a license to print counterfeit money through fraudulent credit. Fraudulent credit can be defined as credit that is designed at origination to be impossible or highly unlikely to be repaid. [(Mirek Fatyga)](blog-integrity-of-money.html)

With the rise of financialization, commercial banks have become increasingly reliant on one another for short-term loans, mostly backed by government bonds, to finance their daily operations. This liquidity acquires familiar properties: used as a means of exchange and as a store of value, it becomes a form of money.
And there’s the rub: as banks issue more inter-bank money, the financial system requires more government bonds to back the increase. The growing inter-bank money supply fuels demand for government debt, in a never-ending cycle that generates tides of liquidity over which central banks have little control.
In this brave new financial world, central banks’ independence is becoming meaningless, because the money they create represents a shrinking share of the total money supply. With the rise of inter-bank money, backed mostly by government debt, fiscal policy has become an essential factor in determining the quantity of actual money lubricating modern capitalism.
Indeed, the more independent a central bank is, the greater the role of fiscal policy in determining the quantity of money in an economy. 
Money and government debt are now so intertwined that the analytical basis for central bank autonomy has disappeared.

#### Crytocurrencies

The market capitalization of cryptocurrencies amounts to nearly one tenth the value of the physical stock of official gold, with the capability to handle significantly larger payment operations, owing to low transaction costs. That means that cryptocurrencies are already systemic in scale. 
The Central Banks can try to reign in cryptocurrencies but the genie is out of the bottle: the entire model that the combination of governments and Central Banks operate is already under huge threat.
Technology basically allows barter to operate on an industrial scale. Technology platforms now open the possibility of direct peer-to-peer transactions, entirely bypassing all banking - retail, merchant and Central. This essentially means the insertion point that governments had into all transactions is lost - which then makes it extremely difficult to extract tax from transactions.
