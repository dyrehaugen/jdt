My life with dogs started at age four.
Making a verb from the noun 'dog' is quite natural for me -
it is about a style og life.

Later it has been 'dogs all over'.

Photographing dogs is an art. Just look here:

This is Zelda at Haglebu - Princess of Norwegian Folk Tales - photo by Lisa 2015.

And as if this is not enough here is another great photo of the princess:

En garde at Lake Tyrifjorden - really a blistering part of Norwegian summer nature -
also by Lisa.

Dog portraits may be the most difficult photo art - here is Raico as Louis XIV.
