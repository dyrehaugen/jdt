Places of particular interest to me.

Staying in Asker, close to Oslo, with the fjord and mountains ut to 400m within walking range, ‘Dyrehaugen’ is my homestead Up North. I would like to document the qualities of Norway - and my own place in particular - as a living environment.

On Gran Canaria - a small bungalow named ‘Casa del Lobo’ is my homestead Down South - a place to enjoy the sun even in the winter time - without losing the sight of snow (on top of Mount Teide - 3500 m)
