### [Modelling Financial Instability](/jdt/minsky.html)

Hyman Minsky's famous *Financial Instability Hypothesis* has been
put into mathemathical terms by Steve Keen and Mathias Grasselli et al.
Steve Keen has also created interactive software for tooling with
these issues. I prefer, however, to treat this type of modelling
by means of C++ coding. 

### [Modelling Corona Outbreak](/jdt/cormod_intro.html)

Epidemological Modelling has gained center stage during the Corona Covid-19 virus outbreak.
Sitting in quarantine in Spain during the outbreak I developed some Julia code to follow
what was going on - focusing on findig empirical *Reproduction Numbers* for selected countries
of particular interest to me. Further development may be to put up some SEIR type of model in Julia.
