A sample of Corona Analysis Data comes here

We fetch the data from
[David Bumbeishvili's Github Repository](https://github.com/bumbeishvili/covid19-daily-data)
The reason for not using the [John Hopkins data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
is that the *Recovered* series in this data was discontinued as of March 23, 2020.
Bumbeishvili also performs some quality checks and improvemnets on the data.
