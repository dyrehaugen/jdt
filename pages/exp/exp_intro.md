Life is experience - if you dare to jump into it!
That sounds nice - but comes at a price - there are risks around.
I started to 'look over the hills' - ventured around and away.
Small expeditions gradually became more daring ....
We will see what to report ...

I am struggling a bit with how to structure this section - a
report on life long learning - what have I really learned?
How did I really learn it?

* Empathy
* Fantasy
* Tolerance
* Curiosity
* Endurance
* Recognition
* Dreaming
* Sharing
* Thinking
* Listening
* Speaking
* Writing
* Insight
* Wisdom
* ?

Are these the important features of what I am today?
Not a list of skills, rather a list of personality issues?

Reporting on these would rather require writing prose or poetry -
may be short stories
linking the setting, interactions and learning outcome in all it's
complexity - not a simple schoollike linear learning staircase.

I will have to put this at the back of my mind for some time to ripen.

Then there is choice of learning approach.
I am a man tilting more towards *learning by doing* rather than *theoretical
reasoning* - learning by *experimentation* and *applied research* if you want.

So - may be trying to recall *episodes* of *learning experience* may work?
