My name is Dyre Haugen. I am a Jack of all trades.
Summertime I live up North - mostly at Dyrehaugen -
more earthly known as JRW56.
Wintertime I live down South - in a nice place codenamed G51.
My great addiction in life is - dogs - i.e. real dogs.
Thus the first activity to report on will be: Dogs
Later will follow: guess what .....
