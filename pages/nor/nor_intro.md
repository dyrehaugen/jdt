Welcome to my Norway - starting off on my small hilltop in Asker, close to the Oslofjord.
This is my local paradise up North.
One of the attractions of staying here is the capability to overview
the shiplane into Oslo Harbour.
Sometime we get surprise visits, like this one:

My family has proud traditions with sailships, so seeing this one - 120 years on -
really made me feel good. New technologies that bring back large sailships
again would be a benefit for us all - may be even some day putting the era of
motor ship pollution behind us.
