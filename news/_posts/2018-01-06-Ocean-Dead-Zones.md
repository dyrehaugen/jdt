Ocean dead zones with zero oxygen have quadrupled in size since 1950,
while the number of very low oxygen sites near coasts have multiplied tenfold.
Most sea creatures cannot survive in these zones and current trends would lead
to mass extinction in the long run,
risking dire consequences for the hundreds of millions of people who depend on the sea.

Climate change caused by fossil fuel burning is the cause of the large-scale deoxygenation,
as warmer waters hold less oxygen.
The coastal dead zones result from fertiliser and sewage running off the land and into the seas.
The analysis, published in the journal Science,
is the first comprehensive analysis of the areas and states:
“Major extinction events in Earth’s history have been associated with warm climates
and oxygen-deficient oceans.”

The increasing expansion of coastal dead zones and decline in open ocean oxygen are not
priority problems for governments around the world.
Unfortunately, it will take severe and persistent mortality of fisheries
for the seriousness of low oxygen to be realised

The oceans feed more than 500 million people, especially in poorer nations,
and provide jobs for 350 million people.
But at least 500 dead zones have now been reported near coasts, up from fewer than 50 in 1950.
Lack of monitoring in many regions means the true number may be much higher.

The open ocean has natural low oxygen areas, usually off the west coast of continents
due to the way the rotation of the Earth affects ocean currents.
But these dead zones have expanded dramatically,
increasing by millions of square kilometres since 1950,
roughly equivalent to the area of the European Union. 

Furthermore, the level of oxygen in all ocean waters is falling, with 2% – 77bn tonnes –
being lost since 1950.
This can reduce growth, impair reproduction and increase disease.
One irony is that warmer waters not only hold less oxygen
but also mean marine organisms have to breathe faster, using up oxygen more quickly.

There are also dangerous feedback mechanisms.
Microbes that proliferate at very low oxygen levels produce lots of nitrous oxide,
a greenhouse gas that is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide.
