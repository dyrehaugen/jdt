Measuring the detoriation of the environment is not easy.
The surveilance of tropical forests has mainly been based on interpretation
of satelite imageniary.
This basically estimate the extent of the tree canopy - an area measure,
assuming that what is below is unchanged.
A new [study](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/28/alarm-as-study-reveals-worlds-tropical-forests-are-huge-carbon-emission-source)
shows that this assumption is dificient - a lot of forest degradation takes place
below the canopy.

This error of estimate is alarming as tropical forest seems not to be the major
carbon sink we have envisaged.
Rather the other way around: Taking what goes on under the canopy into consideration
turns tropical forests into a major carbon *source*.
More carbon seems to be lost to degradation and disturbance than to deforestation proper.
