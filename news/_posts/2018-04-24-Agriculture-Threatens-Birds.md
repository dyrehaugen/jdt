"The State of the World’s Birds", a five-year compendium of population data
from the best-studied group of animals on the planet,
reveals a biodiversity crisis driven by the expansion and
intensification of agriculture.

In all, 74% of 1,469 globally threatened birds are affected primarily by farming.
Logging, invasive species and hunting are the other main threats.

40% of bird species worldwide are in decline.
Overfishing and climate change is affecting seabird species.

Neonicotinoids – widely implicated in flying insect declines (a key bird food source)
– have  been found to be directly detrimental to some bird species. 
The neurotoxin also impaired the birds’ migratory orientation.
