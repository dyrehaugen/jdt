A few days ago I forked Tom Johnson's 'Jekyll Documentation Theme' on GitHub.
I was looking for a web publishing toolset to integrate various web
publishing activities. Jumping around in the file structure gave some
insight of how the theme worked. As from today the Tom's content is
removed and just the framework and tools kept.
Now we will see how useful this approach will be for my purposes.
My intention is to fill in my own stuff on an experimental basis over
time. Just now at the start-up the main use of the site will be as a
linking tool for a set of external (to this site) web content related to
me (Dyre Haugen) and my places on earth (Dyrehaugen and Greco51).
In technical terms this collection can be found under the 'Links'
pulldown meny in the top navigation bar.
Later on new content will be put into the various 'Sections' items and under
the 'Blog' item. So this is very WIP - Work In Progress ....
