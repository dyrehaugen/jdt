Schmitt claims that liberalism has a
tendency to deny the need for genuine political decision, to
suggest that it is neither necessary nor desirable for
individuals to form groups that are constituted by the
drawing of friend-enemy distinctions. Liberals believe that
there are no conflicts among human beings that cannot be
solved to everyone's advantage through an improvement of
civilization, technology, and social organization or be
settled, after peaceful deliberation, by way of amicable
compromise. As a result, liberalism is unable to provide
substantive markers of identity that can ground a true
political decision. Liberal politics, consequently, boils down
to the attempt to domesticate the polity, in the name of the
protection of individual freedom, but it is unable to constitute
political community in the first place

world would offer human beings no higher purpose than to
increase their consumption and to enjoy the frolics of
modern entertainment. It would reduce politics to a value-
neutral technique for the provision of material amenities. As
a result, there would no longer be any project or value that
individuals are called upon to serve, whether they want to or
not, and that can give their life a meaning that transcends
the satisfaction of private desires
