China has just completed it's 19th National Congress of the Communist Party.
Xi has taken on undisputed leadership - almost alongside Mao, and
stronger than Deng ('the reckless capitalist roader').
An entirely new body of “Xi Jinping thought” has been elaborated –
and has now been incorporated into the Party’s constitution.
Capitalist China will remain permanently governed by a Leninist party
that monopolizes state power.

Xi states that China will never import a political system from anywhere else
in the world.
China’s "socialist democracy" (Xi's terminology)
"is the broadest, most genuine, and most effective democracy
to safeguard the fundamental interests of the people"
and it now represents an alternative development model for other nations.

China’s official media have taken the cue.
Government-controlled news outlets have flooded the country with
story after story on why Western-style liberal democracy is now moribund.
Moving beyond the conventional arguments that democratic decision-making
has been ineffective in bringing about long-term economic development,
a new set of arguments has been unveiled:
Western democracy is corrupt, hypocritical, and fails to meet
the needs of the poor.
The global spread of liberal democratic ideas has ground to a halt,
leaving the West’s geopolitical power and prestige ripe for challenge.

When China does become the world’s largest economy over the next decade,
the global system will be led by a non-English-speaking,
non-Western, non-democratic state for the first time. 

Xi is committed to move beyond pure economic growth - focus is now on
fighting corruption and inequalities.

As Western democracies - shanghaied by the rich - seems uanable to do
anything about income distributions, may be an era
of Xi's enlightenment will perform better.
