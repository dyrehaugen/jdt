The pioneering capitalists in California aims for the stars.
The space industry is now driven by private companies,
like Elon Musk's SpaceX.

This may be a sign of Earthly Capitalism meeting
The End of the Road (on Earth).

The Question coming up on the horizon is obviously:
Where does Capitalism go when the complete (surface of the) Globe
is fully globalised?

The answer from California seems to be: Upwards - let us exploit
another Globe, starting with Mars.

I should say: Let them go!

The problem for us left back here on Earth still remains the same:
How to help Earth's Nature recover after the Cancer has left.
