Mathematical systems describing financial instability may be
classified as [dissipative systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissipative_system),
i.e. *a structure characterized by the spontaneous appearance of symmetry breaking (anisotropy)
and the formation of complex, sometimes chaotic, structures where interacting
particles exhibit long range correlations.*

In those branches of mathematics called dynamical systems and ergodic theory,
the concept of a [wandering set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_set)
formalizes a certain idea of movement and mixing in such systems.
When a dynamical system has a wandering set of non-zero measure,
then the system is a dissipative system.
This is very much the opposite of a conservative system,
for which the ideas of the Poincar√© recurrence theorem apply.
Intuitively, the connection between wandering sets and dissipation is easily understood:
if a portion of the phase space "wanders away" during normal time-evolution of the system,
and is never visited again, then the system is dissipative.
The language of wandering sets can be used to give a precise, mathematical definition
to the concept of a dissipative system.

These descriptions from Wikipedia illustrates some of the setting of
[Jing Chen's](http://www.unbc.ca/jing-chen) ambitions in renewing *Economics*
based on analytical thermodynamic theory.

He suggests an unified *entropy theory of value* incorporating both objective
marxian labour theory of value and subjective neoclassical utility theory -

Further he develops an *ecological economics* on the same basis 
[pdf]({{ site.url}}/pdf/Jing_Chen_Ecological_Economics.pdf)

In a discipline where mainstream is almost lost in the fog, Jing Chens aspirations are
very much welcome.
