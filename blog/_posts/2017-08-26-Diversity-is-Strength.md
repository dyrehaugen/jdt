Economics is in for revision.
In a way economics as we know it - i.e. neoclassical - is a fake science.
Fake due to the fact that all the simplifying assumptions makes the
bright logic irrelevant for most practical purposes.
One of todays 'revisionists' is
Steve Keen,
who reminds us of the limits of ricardian trade theory and the limits of
todays economics as defined by [Lionel Robbins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Robbins)
as *the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce
means which have alternative uses*.
Scarcity of means calls for efficiency in use - to be achieved by *specialisation*,
also obtained through *trade* between nations.
However, as
[Keen](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2017/08/ricardos-vice-virtues-industrial-diversity/)
[(pdf)](pdf/Keen.pdf)
points out, by assuming equivalence between *machinery* and *capital* trade theory
overestimates the benefits of international trade.
Thus, there are limits to the benefits of specialisation.
Rather *diversity is strength* as evidenced in the
[Atlas of Economic Complexity](http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/about/glossary/)
*Modern societies can amass large amounts of productive knowledge because they
distribute bits and pieces of it among its many members.
But to make use of it, this knowledge has to be put
back together through organizations and markets.
Thus, individual specialization begets diversity at the national and global level.
Our most prosperous modern societies are wiser, not because their citizens are individually
brilliant, but because these societies hold a diversity of know how and because they are
able to recombine it to create a larger variety of smarter and better products*

Thus, todays economics is not just about allocation of given scarce resources, it is
as much about innovation by knowledge recombinations.
