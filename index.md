# Welcome

Reflecting my life as a 'Jack of all trades' - or at least *some* trades -
this site is a collection of very different contents.
It is at any time WIP - Work In Progress - do not expect a polished/
finished experience. The site is a mirror of my workdesk as it shows
up at any moment - a place to put 'papers and notes' in our paperless era.
Some parts may thus look more finished than others.
You are invited to join a process, not read the final thesis!
Your comments may - as you will se - be delivered through 'Disqus'.

The 'Nav' button on the main meny toggles the sidebar navigation
meny on or off. 

Below I explain shortly what you can expect to find.

## [News](/news.html)

Here I sum up and comment on news related to matters that interest me
- as it happens - no in depth treatment.


## [Blog](/blog.html)

Here I write short pieces and collect references and documentation
on issues that stay on my mind for longer periods of time.
What I write her may well be triggered by events first showing
up under 'News'.

## [Tweets](/tweets.html)

Here I put condensed statements - facts or opinions - on any issue.


## [Sections](/sec_intro.html)

Here I report from my activities or experiences - or
document facts and  opinions on themes that matter to me - the
intention beeing to arrive at well underpinned viewpoints and
positions. The stuff under *Sections* - in particular the
*concerns* section - may well be fed by observations commented
on in 'News' and 'Blog'.

As for now the themes are grouped under these headings:

* [Activities](act_intro.html)
* [Experience](exp_intro.html)
* [Concerns](cnc_intro.html)
* [Research](res_intro.html)
* [Varia](var_intro.html)

I have also wanted to collect and present material related to
the two places on Earth where I stay more permanently.
These sections are:

* [Norway](nor_intro.html)
* [Gran Canaria](grc_intro.html)

## Links 

The links (use top meny to open) are to some of my related web content -
external to this site.
Most links are to previous versions of blogs.
My blogging activity startet back in 2012 with a simple file
written directly in html and put into a apache web server subdirectory
on a leftover computer server runnning Debian Linux.
Later I have tested more elaborate blogging software, like Wordpress
and Jekyll. The current site is based on Tom Johnson's
[Jekyll Documentation Theme](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/index.html) version 6.0 as found on
[Github](https://github.com/tomjoht/documentation-theme-jekyll).
There is as well some links to my temperature logs and webcams in Norway
and information sites for visitors to my homesteads in Norway and on
Gran Canaria.
Also are provided links to the Github repo and mirror of this site.
