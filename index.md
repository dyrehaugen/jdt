# Welcome

Reflecting my life as a 'Jack of all trades' - or at least *some* trades -
this site is a collection of very different contents.
It is at any time WIP - Work In Progress - do not expect a polished/
finished experience. The site is a mirror of my workdesk as it shows
up in any moment - a place to put 'papers and notes' in our paperless era.
Some parts may thus look more finished than others.
You are invited to join a process, not read the final thesis!
Your comments may - as you will se - be supplied on 'Disqus'

The 'Nav' button on the main meny toggles the sidebar navigation
meny on or off. 

Below I explain shortly what you can expect to find.

## News

Here I sum up and comment on news related to matters that interest me
- as it happens - no in depth treatment.


## Blog

Here I write short pieces and collect references and documentation
on issues that stay on my mind for longer periods of time.
What I write her may well be triggered by events first showing
up under 'News'.


## Sections

Here I document facts and opinions on themes that matter to me - the
intention beeing to arrive at well underpinned viewpoints and
positions. The stuff under *Sections* - in particular the
*opinions* section - may well be fed by observations commented
on in 'News' and 'Blog'.

As for now the themes are grouped under three broad headings/sections:

* [Activities](act_intro.html)
* [Experience](exp_intro.html)
* [Opinions](opn_intro.html)

In addition there is a fourth category - for anything else:

* [Varia](var_intro.html)

I have also wanted to document the two places on Earth where I
stay more permanently. These sections are:

* [Norway](nor_intro.html)
* [Gran Canaria](grc_intro.html)

## Links

The links are to some of my related web content - external to this site.
