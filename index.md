## 5. Norway

Staying in Asker, close to Oslo, with the fjord and mountains ut to 400m
within walking range, 'JRW56' is my homestead Up North.
I would like to document the qualities of Norway - and my own place in
particular - as a living environment.

## 6. Gran Canaria

On Gran Canaria - a small bungalow named 'Greco51' is my homestead Down South -
a place to enjoy the sun even in the winter time - without losing the
sight of snow (on top of Mount Teide - 3500 m)
