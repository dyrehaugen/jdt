The global money supply
continues to expand considerably faster than the world economy, as it has
since the 1970s. Broad money was 59 per cent of global gdp in 1970, 104
per cent in 2000 and 125 per cent in 2015.
What is growing, alongside money, is debt: up from 246 per cent of global
gdp in 2000 to 321 per cent in 2016.
